# Security Assessment — SSDLC / CRA / IEC 62443 Gap Analysis

Date: 2026-01-22

## Purpose

This document records a concise security-gap analysis and remediation plan to align this repository with SSDLC expectations and relevant industrial standards including CRA and IEC 62443.

## High-level findings

- The project has solid engineering hygiene: a spec, tests, 100% coverage for `src`, and contribution guidelines.
- Missing key security lifecycle artefacts commonly required by CRA and IEC 62443 (see gap list below).

## Gaps (summary)

1. Security requirements specification — not present.
2. Threat model / risk assessment — not present.
3. Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation — no SBOM in repo.
4. Dependency vulnerability scanning & CVE tracking — not automated in CI.
5. Security-focused static analysis (SAST) — only general linters present; no `bandit`.
6. Security test cases / integration tests for security scenarios — none documented.
7. Vulnerability disclosure & incident response policy — no `SECURITY.md`.
8. Release integrity (checksums / signing) — not present.
9. Design & architecture documentation for security (data flows, trust boundaries) — incomplete.
10. Change/patch management and CVE triage workflow — not formalised.

## Mapping to IEC 62443 (select items)

- SR-2 (Threat modeling): missing
- SVV-1 / SVV-2 (Security verification / testing): missing automated security testing
- DM-1 / DM-2 (Defect & update management): partial (git history present) but no formal SLA/process

## Quick actions (tools + commands)

1. SBOM (CycloneDX):

```bash
pip install cyclonedx-bom
cyclonedx-py -r requirements.txt -o sbom.json
```

2. Dependency audit:

```bash
pip install pip-audit
pip-audit
```

3. Static security scan:

```bash
pip install bandit
bandit -r src/ -ll
```

4. Add `pre-merge` CI steps to run `pip-audit`, `bandit`, and SBOM generation.

## Recommended deliverables (prioritised)

Short term (days):
- `SECURITY.md` (vulnerability reporting + contact + SLA)
- Add `bandit` and `pip-audit` to CI workflow
- Generate SBOM and commit to `dist/` or attach to releases

Medium term (weeks):
- `docs/threat-model.md` (STRIDE or PASTA, data flows and boundaries)
- `docs/security-requirements.md` and `docs/security-design.md`
- Security test cases (fuzzing, input validation, permission tests)

Long term (release governance):
- Release signing or checksums; documented release process
- Formal CVE triage and patching workflow, SLAs
- Periodic third-party code review / penetration testing

## Suggested CI integration (example jobs)

- `security-deps`: run `pip-audit` and fail on issues
- `security-sast`: run `bandit` and fail on high severity
- `sbom`: generate and store SBOM as artifact

## Next steps (what I will do if you instruct)

1. Create `SECURITY.md` and `docs/threat-model.md` templates in the repo.  
2. Add a GitHub Actions workflow that runs `pip-audit` and `bandit`, and generates SBOM on push to branch.  
3. Optionally produce an SBOM now and commit it.
